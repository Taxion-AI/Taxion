## Example

Here is an example of how to use the Taxion SDK to automate tasks:

```javascript
const Taxion = require('taxion-sdk');

const config = {
    "Telegram_UID": "YOUR-TELEGRAM-UID",
    "Brevo_API-KEY": "YOUR-BREVO-APIKEY",
    "Email": "email@domain.com"
};

const prompt = new Taxion(config);

prompt.execute("Automate a daily report summarizing the latest news and stock price movements for Nvidia, Intel, and Microsoft. Report it daily into my email starting today")
    .email("example@email.com");
```

### Detailed Execution Flow

When you execute a command like `prompt.execute("Automate a daily report summarizing the latest news and stock price movements for Nvidia, Intel, and Microsoft. Report it daily into my email starting today")`, the SDK performs the following steps:

1. **Analyze Intent**: The command is analyzed using OpenAI's GPT-4 model to understand the user's intent. The AI categorizes the tasks and breaks them down into actionable steps.

2. **Structure Actions**: Based on the analyzed intent, the SDK structures an action plan. For the given example, the action plan would be:
    ```
    [!] Action Plan:
    OTE/1   | Gather daily news on NVDA, INTC, and MSFT  | [HEAD]
    OTE/2   | Fetch 1W stock price history               | [CHAINED]
    OTE/3   | Generate summary using LLM                 | [CHAINED]
    OTE/4   | Send & schedule daily email via Brevo      | [CHAINED]
    ```

3. **Execute Actions**: Each action is executed sequentially:
    - **Gather daily news**: The SDK uses a search API integration to fetch the latest news articles related to Nvidia, Intel, and Microsoft.
    - **Fetch stock price history**: The SDK retrieves the past week's stock price data for the specified companies using financial data APIs like AlphaVantage.
    - **Generate summary**: The SDK leverages OpenAI's language model to generate a concise summary of the gathered news and stock data.
    - **Send & schedule email**: The SDK connects to the Brevo API to send and schedule the generated report to the specified email address.

4. **Logging and Monitoring**: Throughout the execution, the SDK logs each step and monitors for any errors or warnings. This ensures transparency and allows for troubleshooting if needed.

const taxion = require("taxion");

const config = {
    "Telegram_UID": "YOUR-TELEGRAM-UID",
    "Brevo_API-KEY": "YOUR-BREVO-APIKEY",
    "Email": "email@domain.com"
};

const prompt = new Taxion(config);
```

### Step 2: Unleash Intelligent Automation

Let our LLM-powered SDK analyze your request and intelligently chain multiple actions into a structured execution plan. Sit back and watch as Taxion does the heavy lifting for you.
